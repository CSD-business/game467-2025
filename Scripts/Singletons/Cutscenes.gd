"Hey! No press is permitted past this point! Move along!",
"Are the reports of people disappearing into the mansion true? Are there plans for a search team to go inside?",
"Did you not hear what I said!? Press is not permitted!",
"You heard the man. This is an active police scene, nobody is allowed in at the moment.",
